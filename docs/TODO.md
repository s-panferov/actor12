# Actor12 Framework - TODO List

This document outlines improvements and tasks needed to make Actor12 production-ready. Tasks are organized by priority and category.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### API Consistency
- [ ] **Fix example compilation errors**: Several examples use incorrect method names (`call()` vs `ask_dyn()`, `exec()` vs `handle()`)
- [ ] **Standardize Handler trait usage**: Examples show `async fn exec()` but trait requires `handle()` method
- [ ] **Fix Actor::init signatures**: Examples use incompatible init parameter types
- [ ] **Remove .unwrap() from critical paths**: Replace panics with proper error handling in `envelope.rs:29` and other locations
- [ ] **Replace std::process::exit(-1)**: Actor::crash() is too aggressive for library code

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Implement comprehensive error types**: Create ActorError enum with proper error classification
- [ ] **Add error propagation**: Ensure errors bubble up through actor hierarchy
- [ ] **Remove panic-based error handling**: Replace all `.unwrap()` calls with proper error handling
- [ ] **Add timeout handling**: Implement timeouts for actor operations

## ðŸ”¥ High Priority (Production Essentials)

### Supervision System
- [ ] **Implement supervisor hierarchy**: Parent actors should manage child lifecycle
- [ ] **Add restart strategies**: OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne patterns
- [ ] **Create health checking**: Monitor actor responsiveness and health
- [ ] **Add circuit breaker patterns**: Failure isolation and recovery
- [ ] **Implement actor lifecycle events**: Start, stop, restart, crash events

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Create comprehensive test suite**: Cover all major functionality
- [ ] **Add integration tests**: Test actor interactions and message flows
- [ ] **Implement property-based tests**: Use proptest for edge case coverage
- [ ] **Add benchmark suite**: Measure performance characteristics
- [ ] **Create test utilities**: ActorTestHarness, timeout helpers, assertion utilities
- [ ] **Test cancellation propagation**: Verify hierarchical cancellation works correctly
- [ ] **Test memory cleanup**: Ensure actors are properly garbage collected

### Documentation
- [ ] **Add doc comments to all public APIs**: Include usage examples and safety notes
- [ ] **Create conceptual documentation**: Actor lifecycle, message flows, best practices
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting guide**: Common problems and solutions
- [ ] **Create architecture diagrams**: Visual representation of actor system design
- [ ] **Fix and expand examples**: Ensure all examples compile and demonstrate real patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Medium Priority (Enhanced Functionality)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Implement message batching**: Process multiple messages at once for throughput
- [ ] **Add configurable channel types**: Support different channel implementations (bounded, unbounded, priority)
- [ ] **Optimize Arc usage**: Reduce unnecessary Arc clones in hot paths
- [ ] **Implement zero-copy message passing**: Where possible, avoid message copying
- [ ] **Add channel buffer configuration**: Allow tuning of channel buffer sizes

### Enhanced Communication
- [ ] **Implement pub/sub system**: Event broadcasting capabilities
- [ ] **Add message routing**: Route messages based on content or patterns
- [ ] **Create load balancing**: Distribute work across actor pools
- [ ] **Implement backpressure handling**: Flow control for overloaded actors
- [ ] **Add priority messaging**: High-priority message queues

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Create actor derive macro**: Simplify actor definition with `#[actor]`
- [ ] **Add builder pattern for spawning**: Fluent API for actor configuration
- [ ] **Implement typed message system**: Compile-time message verification
- [ ] **Add debugging tools**: Message tracing, actor visualization
- [ ] **Create IDE integration**: Language server support for actor patterns

### State Management
- [ ] **Add state persistence**: Save/restore actor state
- [ ] **Implement snapshots**: Checkpoint actor state for recovery  
- [ ] **Create event sourcing support**: Event log replay capability
- [ ] **Add state migration**: Handle actor state schema changes

## ðŸ”§ Low Priority (Nice to Have)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Networking support**: Remote actor communication
- [ ] **Service discovery**: Locate actors across processes/machines
- [ ] **Message serialization**: Built-in serde support for network transport
- [ ] **Distributed supervision**: Cross-node actor supervision

### Ecosystem Integration  
- [ ] **Metrics integration**: Prometheus/OpenTelemetry support
- [ ] **Tracing integration**: Distributed tracing with correlation IDs
- [ ] **Database integration**: Async connection pooling patterns
- [ ] **HTTP integration**: Handle web requests in actors
- [ ] **Configuration management**: External configuration support

### Additional Examples
- [ ] **Supervision tree example**: Demonstrate parent-child relationships
- [ ] **Request routing example**: Show content-based message routing
- [ ] **State machine example**: Actor with multiple states
- [ ] **Resource pool example**: Database connection pool pattern
- [ ] **Event sourcing example**: Append-only event log pattern
- [ ] **Distributed system example**: Multi-node actor communication
